            <h2>Youtubability</h2>
            <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong>to a potential player.</p>

            <p> Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the
                    lowest possible CPIs</strong>
                for your games.</p>

            <p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer: </p>

            <p>For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is<strong> evident</strong>, for
                example, can she tell which character she
                <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong> objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong>fun to
                    play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).
            </p>


            <p>Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted </strong>
                (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>

            <p>If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street,
                it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order
                to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong> Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and
                    controls </strong>of the game,
                like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the
                space
                dedicated to drawing.

        <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook feed</strong>,
            everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
            <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a
                small
                screen.</strong>
            With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive
            thumbnail -
            it’s the same idea for your game videos.</p>
